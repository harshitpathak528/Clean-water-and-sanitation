# Intro about our topic and why we choice it
Clean water and sanitation are fundamental needs for all human beings, yet millions of people around the world lack access to these basic necessities. In developing countries, the lack of clean water and adequate sanitation results in the deaths of millions every year due to hazardous conditions and waterborne diseases. This is a problem that can be prevented through inexpensive and effective alternatives.

Access to clean water and sanitation is essential for public health. According to the World Health Organization, safe drinking water and adequate sanitation conditions can prevent the spread of diseases such as cholera, dysentery, typhoid, and polio. However, in many developing countries, these basic services are lacking. Approximately 1.1 billion people in the world do not have access to improved drinking water, and an estimated 2.6 billion individuals live without any type of water services. This is a significant problem, as waterborne diseases are responsible for the deaths of an estimated 840,000 people every year.

Sanitation is also a major issue in developing countries. Sanitation is defined as the conditions related to public health, including the provision of clean drinking water and adequate sewage disposal. The lack of sanitation in developing countries is a larger problem than the lack of water. Many communities in the developing world lack proper sewage systems, and open defecation is a common practice. This leads to the contamination of water sources and the spread of diseases.

The United Nations has recognized the importance of clean water and sanitation and has set a goal to establish a system that will provide full access to safe drinking water and sanitation by 2030. While progress has been made in increasing access to clean water and sanitation, there are still many challenges and obstacles to overcome. According to the Millennium Development Goals Report 2012, 783 million people, or 11% of the global population, remain without access to an improved source of drinking water. The report also states that coverage remains very low in Oceania and sub-Saharan Africa, where 40% of all people without improved drinking water live.

Improving access to clean water and sanitation requires a multi-faceted approach. Technology and engineering problem-solving can help to provide sustainable and cost-effective solutions. Collaboration and research are also essential to developing new and innovative approaches to addressing this global challenge.

One organization that is making a difference in providing clean water and sanitation to communities in need is The Water Project. Through the installation of wells and water purification systems, The Water Project is providing clean water to communities in Sierra Leone, Kenya, and Uganda. Bottled water is also an option for providing clean water to communities in need.

In conclusion, clean water and sanitation are essential for public health and are fundamental human rights. Millions of people around the world lack access to these basic necessities, resulting in the deaths of millions every year due to hazardous sanitation conditions and waterborne diseases. While progress has been made in increasing access to clean water and sanitation, there are still many challenges and obstacles to overcome. Through technology, research, collaboration, and engineering problem-solving, we can work towards a future where everyone has access to clean water and adequate sanitation.
